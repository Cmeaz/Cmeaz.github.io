    <p> I like to play sports and video games. I like to make food and hang out with friends.
    I have 3 dogs 2 girl and 1 male. I have a cat that is annoying and is a girl. I am 14 and go
    to Craig Highschool. I don't know what I want to do when I grow up.
    
    <p> My favorite type of pet is a Cat. I know I said mine is annoying but they can be really 
    funny sometimes.

    <p> I don't have a Favorite song, but I like Rap music, Specifically Jcole. He is a cool rapper
    and nice to calm you down and listen to.

    <p> My Favorite Movies are Lion king, Batman/newest one, and Megan.
