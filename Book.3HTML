<h1> Muffins, the early years</h1>
<hr>
<p> Hi. My name is muffins. i am a might cat.
I was adopted three weeks old.</p>
<p> My new mommy is a human. They are funny creatures. </p>
<p>I left the pound with my new mommy and new sister, Maria. 
They took me straight to the pet store to buy:</p>

<ul>
<li> A kitty baby bottle and formula</li>
<li> a small cloth toy</ti>
<li> Litter box with Litter</li>
<li>Food (for later)</li></ul>
<p>Mom and sis had to feed me by bottle because i was so young.</p>
